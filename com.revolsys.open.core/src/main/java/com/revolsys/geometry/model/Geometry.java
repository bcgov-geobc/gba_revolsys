/**
 * A representation of a planar, linear vector geometry.
 * <P>
 *
 *  <H3>Binary Predicates</H3>
 * Because it is not clear at this time
 * what semantics for spatial
 * analysis methods involving <code>GeometryCollection</code>s would be useful,
 * <code>GeometryCollection</code>s are not supported as arguments to binary
 * predicates or the <code>relate</code>
 * method.
 *
 * <H3>Overlay Methods</H3>
 *
 * The overlay methods
 * return the most specific class possible to represent the result. If the
 * result is homogeneous, a <code>Point</code>, <code>LineString</code>, or
 * <code>Polygon</code> will be returned if the result contains a single
 * element; otherwise, a <code>MultiPoint</code>, <code>MultiLineString</code>,
 * or <code>MultiPolygon</code> will be returned. If the result is
 * heterogeneous a <code>GeometryCollection</code> will be returned. <P>
 *
 * Because it is not clear at this time what semantics for set-theoretic
 * methods involving <code>GeometryCollection</code>s would be useful,
 * <code>GeometryCollections</code>
 * are not supported as arguments to the set-theoretic methods.
 *
 *  <H4>Representation of Computed Geometries </H4>
 *
 *  The SFS states that the result
 *  of a set-theoretic method is the "point-set" result of the usual
 *  set-theoretic definition of the operation (SFS 3.2.21.1). However, there are
 *  sometimes many ways of representing a point set as a <code>Geometry</code>.
 *  <P>
 *
 *  The SFS does not specify an unambiguous representation of a given point set
 *  returned from a spatial analysis method. One goal of JTS is to make this
 *  specification precise and unambiguous. JTS uses a canonical form for
 *  <code>Geometry</code>s returned from overlay methods. The canonical
 *  form is a <code>Geometry</code> which is simple and noded:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI> Simple means that the Geometry returned will be simple according to
 *    the JTS definition of <code>isSimple</code>.
 *    <LI> Noded applies only to overlays involving <code>LineString</code>s. It
 *    means that all intersection points on <code>LineString</code>s will be
 *    present as endpoints of <code>LineString</code>s in the result.
 *  </UL>
 *  This definition implies that non-simple geometries which are arguments to
 *  spatial analysis methods must be subjected to a line-dissolve process to
 *  ensure that the results are simple.
 *
 *  <H4> Constructed Point And The Precision Model </H4>
 *
 *  The results computed by the set-theoretic methods may
 *  contain constructed points which are not present in the input <code>Geometry</code>
 *  s. These new points arise from intersections between line segments in the
 *  edges of the input <code>Geometry</code>s. In the general case it is not
 *  possible to represent constructed points exactly. This is due to the geometryFactory
 *  that the coordinates of an intersection point may contain twice as many bits
 *  of precision as the coordinates of the input line segments. In order to
 *  represent these constructed points explicitly, JTS must truncate them to fit
 *  the <code>PrecisionModel</code>. <P>
 *
 *  Unfortunately, truncating coordinates moves them slightly. Line segments
 *  which would not be coincident in the exact result may become coincident in
 *  the truncated representation. This in turn leads to "topology collapses" --
 *  situations where a computed element has a lower dimension than it would in
 *  the exact result. <P>
 *
 *  When JTS detects topology collapses during the computation of spatial
 *  analysis methods, it will throw an exception. If possible the exception will
 *  report the location of the collapse. <P>
 *
 * <h3>Geometry Equality</h3>
 *
 * There are two ways of comparing geometries for equality:
 * <b>structural equality</b> and <b>topological equality</b>.
 *
 * <h4>Structural Equality</h4>
 *
 * Structural Equality is provided by the
 * {@link #equals(2,Geometry)} method.
 * This implements a comparison based on exact, structural pointwise
 * equality.
 * The {@link #equals(Object)} is a synonym for this method,
 * to provide structural equality semantics for
 * use in Java collections.
 * It is important to note that structural pointwise equality
 * is easily affected by things like
 * ring order and component order.  In many situations
 * it will be desirable to normalize geometries before
 * comparing them (using the {@link #norm()}
 * or {@link #normalize()} methods).
 * {@link #equalsNorm(Geometry)} is provided
 * as a convenience method to compute equality over
 * normalized geometries, but it is expensive to use.
 * Finally, {@link #equalsExact(Geometry, double)}
 * allows using a tolerance value for point comparison.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Topological Equality</h4>
 *
 * Topological Equality is provided by the
 * {@link #equalsTopo(Geometry)} method.
 * It implements the SFS definition of point-set equality
 * defined in terms of the DE-9IM matrix.
 * To support the SFS naming convention, the method
 * {@link #equals(Geometry)} is also provided as a synonym.
 * However, due to the potential for confusion with {@link #equals(Object)}
 * its use is discouraged.
 * <p>
 * Since {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} are overridden,
 * Geometries can be used effectively in Java collections.
