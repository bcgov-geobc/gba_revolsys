     * line. This is possibly due to the arithmetic in the translation to the
     * origin.
     *
     * For instance, the following situation produces identical results in spite
     * of the inverse orientation of the line segment:
     *
     * Point p0 = new PointDouble((double)219.3649559090992, 140.84159161824724);

     * orient = orientationIndex(p0, p1, p); int orientInv =
     * orientationIndex(p1, p0, p);
     *
     * A way to force consistent results is to normalize the orientation of the
     * vector using the following code. However, this may make the results of
     * orientationIndex inconsistent through the triangle of points, so it's not
     * clear this is an appropriate patch.
