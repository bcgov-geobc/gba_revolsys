/**
 * Monotone Chains are a way of partitioning the segments of a linestring to
 * allow for fast searching of intersections. They have the following
 * properties:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the segments within a monotone chain never intersect each other
 * <li>the envelope of any contiguous subset of the segments in a monotone chain
 * is equal to the envelope of the endpoints of the subset.
 * </ol>
 * Property 1 means that there is no need to test pairs of segments from within
 * the same monotone chain for intersection.
 * <p>
 * Property 2 allows an efficient binary search to be used to find the
 * intersection points of two monotone chains. For many types of real-world
 * data, these properties eliminate a large number of segment comparisons,
 * producing substantial speed gains.
 * <p>
 * One of the goals of this implementation of MonotoneChains is to be as space
 * and time efficient as possible. One design choice that aids this is that a
 * MonotoneChain is based on a subarray of a list of points. This means that new
 * arrays of points (potentially very large) do not have to be allocated.
 * <p>
 * MonotoneChains support the following kinds of queries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>BoundingBox select: determine all the segments in the chain which
 * intersect a given envelope
 * <li>Overlap: determine all the pairs of segments in two chains whose
 * envelopes overlap
 * </ul>
 * This implementation of MonotoneChains uses the concept of internal iterators
 * to return the resultsets for the above queries. This has time and space
 * advantages, since it is not necessary to build lists of instantiated objects
 * to represent the segments returned by the query. However, it does mean that
 * the queries are not thread-safe.
 *
 * @version 1.7
