/**
 * Computes an approximate intersection of two line segments
 * by taking the most central of the endpoints of the segments.
 * This is effective in cases where the segments are nearly parallel
 * and should intersect at an endpoint.
 * It is also a reasonable strategy for cases where the
 * endpoint of one segment lies on or almost on the interior of another one.
 * Taking the most central endpoint ensures that the computed intersection
 * point lies in the envelope of the segments.
 * Also, by always returning one of the input points, this should result
 * in reducing segment fragmentation.
 * Intended to be used as a last resort for
 * computing ill-conditioned intersection situations which
 * cause other methods to fail.
